title: How Life Should Be - Part 2
---

This is a short follow up the essay to [How Life Should Be](https://friedpaper.xyz/how_life_should_be/).
I'm following up because Life is so Complicated and Messy that Volumes of books don't help.
Let alone an [essay](https://friedpaper.xyz/how_life_should_be/ "How Life Should Be").

The Problem with the last essay is that it doesn't tell you what to do.
I know I quoted Victor Frankl.
But if I'm  being honest it's not much help.
Don't get me wrong.
It is true.
Very True.
And still, a little guidance won't hurt.
I won't tell you what to do.
All I will tell you is a little principle I follow in guiding my actions.
If you got your own little principle that works for you, you can stop reading and do what works for you.
But, if you feel like the goals you choose feel random or like the shiny thing of the day, then what I have to say might help you.

Now, I'm not going to tell you what to do.
I merely show the light.
You have to walk the path.ðŸ˜œ

We only get 22 lives.
Or is it 53?
I don't care.
As long as I'm alive in this life, it's all I care about.
And I want to lead the most wonderful, exciting, rich life possible.
And what I need to be able to do that is Power.
Yes.
It's Power.
Most people lead powerless lives.
They have no power.
Means they don't have the ability to make things happen.
Instead things happen to them.
And there's nothing they can do about it.
And Power's not one of them.

You might be gifted with Power by virtue of birth.
Or you might not.
See, Power is like a baby.
Not everyone of us have it.
But everyone of us can make it.
Yes.
You can manufacture Power.
What you need to do is Build Leverage.
That's all you need to do to gain Power.

All this talk about Power is because to live a great life, you need to survive first.
You need to not worry about Paying Bills.
Finding Food.
Finding Clothes.
Buying Groceries.

Power can take many forms.
One of them is Money(ClicheÂ´).
Money is not everything.
But it's Something.
It's important.
You need to get Self-Dependent first to do great work or to live great life.
