title: How Life Should Be.
---

I'm just about to turn 21.
So I don't have much experience in the _job of life_.
Yes, 20 years of experience is still not enough to be a master of life.
Imagine doing something for 20 years and still suck at it. It's nuts.

I've tried a great many approaches to life.
And a great many came crashing down.
I searched for the _Meaning of Life_.
It cost me money, time, mental health.
Until one day I found _Stoicism_.
It is _changing_ my life.
I'm still not perfect at it.
There is no perfect stoic.
Only growing stoic.
But, Stoicism is only a part of the answer.
I will get back to this later.

Stoicism a is philosophy of life.
Stoicism is a few centuries old.
See, Our minds are made to look at life as a loop.
By that, I mean our brains our optimized to find the things that happen over and over again. Whatever they are.
When we see many of the same thing, we classify them i.e, we put them into a class.
It is our single greatest gift.

I'm going to tell you a story.
A lame one.
Have a little patience and get through this paragraph.
I'm trying to make a point.
OK.
Imagine this.
Our early ancestors, saw an animal. It has yellow skin. Hair on Head. Half as tall.
They won't yet give it a name and the animal doesn't mean anything to them.
But then, they see it again, this time with a little variation.
And then, again. And again. And again. And again.
Now the animal starts to mean something to them.
They start to name them as lions.
They don't think about a single lion.
Now they think about it as a whole.
For example, they're going to think - "Lions feed on other animals" or "They poop near rivers" whatever.
But they don't think about a single animal.
They think of them as a class(group).
As soon as they see one, they know what it does, where it goes, how it behaves.
We see patterns and we make them into classes.

So, What if we try to take the same approach with problems in life. You don't deal with a problem as if it were a brand-new-once-in-a-millennium problem. You classify them, make them into a class. And find a solution collectively. Now, I know you don't have fewer problems. But atleast you know how to deal with them. This takes the sting out of a lot of problems.

That is exactly what the ancient stoics did.
If anybody asks me what Stoicism is, I'll say this: _A HandBook of Life_.
Yes. Really.
It is a HandBook of Life.
See, the Stoics took the same approach to life.
They classified problems in life and found solutions to them.
They sat around a pillar, discussed and experimented all of their life what the best solution to a problem is.
To make human life better.
To discover What the Best Way to Live is.
And they Succeeded in doing that.
Not just Succeeded, they excelled.

In my opinion, if you want to live the best life possible for you, you should adopt Stoicism into you life.
It tells how your life should be.
Stoicism is not rigid like other religions.(I know stoicism is not a religion, but still, isn't religion a philosophy of life too?).
Stoicism has no pope or leaders.
To describe it a little loosely, _Stoicism is not unlike today's Open Source Philosophy_.
For me personally, I think it is a true Hacker's philosophy.
It's open to everybody. No matter who you are.
You can copy its philosophical code and mold it to your liking.
You can test it.
If it doesn't work, change it.
It doesn't exist for academic debates. It exists for real life.
Stoicism does not require blind faith.
Stoicism is based on truth and what works.
Stoics are realists.

Stoics offer a bunch of techniques to deal with whatever comes in life.
You are blessed, to say the least, if you could understand stoicism.
Now if you are interested in adopting stoicism, Here's what you shouldn't do:

-->Don't study about stoicism on the web or don't look at summaries of stoicism. Those summaries don't even scratch the surface and they miss so much context.

Here's what you should do:

-->Get a good book. Don't pick up a very old one. They're like legacy code. Hard to Understand. Try translated versions.
A Good example is: [A Guide to the Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life).
I think, in fact, this is the best book on stoicism.
I strongly recommend this book because, the author made his own changes to stoicism that is even better.

-->An open mind is a prerequisite.

That answers the question of _How Life Should be_: Stoic.
Sadly, there is another important part that Stoicism neglects: Direction.
It doesn't tell you what to do in life.
It tells you what's worth pursuing and what's not.
But not what to do.
At first, I thought this is a serious defect.
But as they say, _It's not a bug, It's a feature_.
And I understood why.
In its own way, Stoicism tells you, You can do Whatever you want.
You have all the choices in the whole wide world.
What do you want to be?
To quote Victor Frankl, 
>Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.
