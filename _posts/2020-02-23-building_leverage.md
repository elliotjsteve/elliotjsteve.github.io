title: Building Leverage
---

The idea of Building Leverage is a direct child of Darwin's Theory of _Survival of the Fittest._
You Survival depends on the Leverage you have against the people in your community.

If I were you, this is what I will work on.

### Routine

You should work on and have a consistent Routine because it's a matter of will.
Will is the glue that holds your dreams and reality together.
Following your routine no matter what instills confidence in yourself, which ups your odds of Success.



### Case-Study

You don't have to re-invent fire.
There's a good amount of chance that everything you want to do has already been done by someone before you.
Learn from them.
See what they did.
Save Yourself a lot of trouble and hassle.


### Capital

I need Capital before I obtain Power.
I plan to do that via BugBounties.
Which I means I have to learn to Hack(which incidentally I love by the way).
I have a long way to go before I even have to start to think about BugBounties.
I will start with the first-form of Hacking, i.e. SourceHacking.


### Feyzing

(In honor of Richard Feynman)

Remember [how the Stoics](https://friedpaper.xyz/how_life_should_be/ "Read How_Life_Should_Be") grouped together problems and found a common solution to a class of problems.
I call that Feyzing, in honor of [Richard Feynman](https://friedpaper.xyz/richard_feynman/).
I think Feyzing is his secret weapon.
My theory is that he would know about every kind of problem there is and learn from them.
He would group them.
And when time comes, he uses his secret weapon.
When Feynman got ill before his death in 1988, he left Caltech with 2 quotes written on his office [black board](http://archives-dc.library.caltech.edu/islandora/object/ct1%3A483/datastream/JPG/view).
One Said, 
> What I Cannot Create, I do not Understand.
The Other Said, 
> Know how to Solve every Problem that has been Solved.
I think Feyzing is what he meant by the second quote.

There are many problems.
You should classify them.
And find their solutions as principles.
For example, all problems of Time Management.
All problems of being a Detective.
All problems of exploitation.
You get the idea.
